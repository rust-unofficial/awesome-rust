# Contributing

Do you want to contribute? We'd love that.

Our goal is to have mostly projects that are stable and useful to many users.

## How?

The easiest way is to go to https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust/blob/master/README.md and click on the "pen" icon in the top right corner. Make the changes to the file and follow the instructions to create a pull request.

If you want to add an entry to the `README.md` please consider this:

- is the entry valuable to people trying to get things done in Rust?
- if you want to add something, please open an PR and use the template `[XXX/YYY](https://github.com/XXX/YYY) [[YYY](https://crates.io/crates/YYY)] — DESCRIPTION [<img src="https://api.travis-ci.org/XXX/YYY.svg?branch=master">](https://travis-ci.org/XXX/YYY)`
- please pay attention to the alphabetical ordering
